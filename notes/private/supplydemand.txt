Market Supply

Supply represents the quantity that producers are willing and able to sell at various prices during a given period of time.
Law of Supply: As price rises, quantity supplied also rises (upward sloping supply curve). Higher prices increase profitability and incentivize more production.
Supply is influenced by input costs, number of sellers, technology, taxes/subsidies, expectations.
Supply curve shifts right (increases) due to lower input costs, more sellers, better technology, favorable taxes.
Supply curve shifts left (decreases) due to higher costs, fewer sellers, outdated technology, unfavorable taxes.

Market Demand

Demand represents the quantity that consumers are willing and able to purchase at various prices during a given period of time.
Law of Demand: As price falls, quantity demanded rises (downward sloping demand curve). Lower prices increase consumer purchasing power.
Demand is influenced by consumer income, prices of related goods, consumer tastes/preferences, number of buyers.

Demand curve shifts right (increases) with higher income, higher prices of substitutes, lower prices of complements, population growth.
Demand curve shifts left (decreases) with lower income, lower prices of substitutes, higher prices of complements, population decline.

Market Equilibrium

Determined by the intersection of the supply and demand curves
Equilibrium price is where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded
Excess supply (surplus) exists if price is above the equilibrium
Excess demand (shortage) exists if price is below the equilibrium
Market forces push price toward the equilibrium to resolve imbalances

Supply and Demand Dynamics

Shifts in supply or demand cause the entire equilibrium point to change
Excess demand raises equilibrium price and quantity; excess supply lowers them
Government policies like taxes, subsidies, price controls can disrupt market equilibrium
Supply and demand analysis helpful for understanding real-world markets

The interplay of supply and demand is fundamental to analyzing how market prices are determined and how quantities transacted in perfectly competitive markets adjust to changes in market conditions.
