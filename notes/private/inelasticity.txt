Inelastic Demand (Elasticity < 1)

Quantity demanded changes less than proportionally to a price change
Total revenue moves in the same direction as the price change
Examples: Necessities (food, gasoline), goods with no close substitutes, addictive goods

Implications of Inelastic Demand

Firms can raise prices to increase total revenue
Consumers have limited ability to avoid price increases
Tax incidence falls more heavily on consumers

Factors Causing Inelastic Demand

Lack of substitutes available
Good is a necessity or essentialitem
Consumption is from habit or addiction
Shorter time periods (less flexibility to adjust)

Inelastic Supply (Elasticity < 1)

Quantity supplied is less responsive to price changes
Can occur in short run when firms can't easily adjust production levels
Examples: Agricultural goods with long growing cycles, manufactured goods requiring specialized inputs

Implications of Inelastic Supply

Restricting output can sharply raise prices and revenues
Easy for suppliers to pass along cost increases to consumers
Tax incidence falls more heavily on producers

Perfecting Inelasticity

A coefficient of zero means demand/supply is perfectly inelastic
Quantity is completely unresponsive to any price changes
Few examples in reality due to substitute availability

Importance of Inelasticity

Crucial factor in incidence analysis of taxes/subsidies
Affects price-setting strategies and revenue management
Highlights lack of available substitutes or flexibility
Identifies essentiality or lack of substitution possibilities

Elasticity tends to vary across different portions of a demand or supply curve. 
Inelastic portions represent relatively unresponsive regions insensitive to price fluctuations.
