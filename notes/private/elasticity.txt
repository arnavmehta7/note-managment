Price Elasticity of Demand

Measures how responsive quantity demanded is to a change in price
Calculated as: % Change in Quantity Demanded / % Change in Price
Elasticities greater than 1 are considered elastic (very responsive to price changes)
Elasticities less than 1 are considered inelastic (less responsive to price changes)
Determinants: Availability of substitutes, necessity vs. luxury, time period

Price Elasticity of Supply

Measures how responsive quantity supplied is to a change in price
Calculated as: % Change in Quantity Supplied / % Change in Price
Usually inelastic in the short run (difficult to rapidly adjust production)
More elastic in the long run as firms can modify production levels

Cross-Price Elasticity

Measures responsiveness of demand for one good to a change in price of another good
Substitutes have positive cross-price elasticity
Complements have negative cross-price elasticity

Income Elasticity

Measures responsiveness of demand to a change in consumer income
Positive for normal goods (demand rises as income rises)
Negative for inferior goods (demand falls as income rises)

Elasticity Along a Linear Demand Curve

Elasticity varies at different points along a linear demand curve
More elastic (flatter portion) at higher prices/quantities
Less elastic (steeper portion) at lower prices/quantities

Applications and Significance

Crucial for firms' pricing strategies and understanding revenue impacts
Factors into tax incidence and deadweight loss analysis
Useful for forecasting impacts of changing incomes or prices
Highlights differences between necessities vs luxuries
Important for government policies related to taxes, subsidies, regulations

Limitations and Assumptions

Depends on accurate measurement of prices and quantities
Assumes ceteris paribus (all other factors constant)
Periods of analysis can impact calculated elasticities
Problematic with extreme valuations (zero prices or infinities)

The elasticity concepts describe the degrees of responsiveness or sensitivities for various demand and supply relationships.
