Definition: An externality arises when a party's actions affect others who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit. It is a spillover impact not reflected in market prices.

Types of Externalities:
Negative Externality - Third party bears some cost (e.g. pollution)
Positive Externality - Third party receives some benefit (e.g. vaccinations)

Causes of Externalities:
Lack of Property Rights - Poorly defined ownership allows external costs
High Transaction Costs - Difficult to negotiate with all affected parties
Irrational Behavior - Individuals may ignore external impacts

Market Failure from Externalities:
Negative externalities lead to oversupply/overconsumption
Positive externalities lead to undersupply/underconsumption
Prices do not account for full social costs and benefits

Inefficient Allocation of Resources:
Negative externality: Too many resources devoted to that good/activity
Positive externality: Too few resources devoted

Internalizing Externalities - Policies to adjust incentives:
Taxes - On goods generating negative externalities
Subsidies - For goods generating positive externalities
Tradable Permits - Market for rights to externality-causing activity
Regulations - Limits or bans on certain economic activities
Property Rights - Assigning ownership to incentivize responsibility

Evaluating Externality Policies:
Compare costs of intervention to potential benefits
Risk of inefficiencies, unintended consequences from policies
Measurement challenges in quantifying externalities precisely
Political incentives and feasibility of implementation

Negative Externality Examples:
Pollution (air, water, noise), greenhouse gas emissions, secondhand smoke
Depletion of shared resources (forests, fisheries)
Traffic congestion, crime

Positive Externality Examples:
Education (promotes economic growth, lowers crime)
Vaccinations (reduces spread of disease)
Innovation and new technology (benefits society broadly)

Significance of Externalities:
Common source of market failures requiring intervention
Divergence between private returns and overall social welfare
Impacts allocation of resources and economic efficiency
Many real-world examples across different markets and industries
Potential role for government to represent third parties affected

Assumptions:
People are rational and recognize their best interests
Externalities are measurable and can be valued in monetary terms
Government can effectively design and implement policies

Extensions:
Network Externalities - One person's utility affected by others' choices
Intra-household Externalities - Within families/households
Global Externalities - Across countries, borders (e.g. climate change)
